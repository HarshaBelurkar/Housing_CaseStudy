# Housing_CaseStudy

## Problem Statement:
A real estate company has the data of real-estate prices. The company wants to optimise the selling price of the properties, based on important factors such as area, bedrooms, parking, etc.

## Approach:
Build a  Multi Linear Regression model after doing the Exploratory Data Analysis and then identifying the driver variables.

The built Multi Linear Regression model fulfills the following objectives

1. Identification of the variables that affects the house prices, e.g., area, number of rooms, bathrooms, etc.
2. A linear model that quantitatively relates house prices with variables, such as the number of rooms, area, number of bathrooms, etc.
3. To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. how well do these variables predict the house prices.
